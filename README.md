--Adventure Game--

In this project I showcase some of my current skills using python to create a small text-based adventure game.

The game should have the user make a choice and should play different scenarios based on which option is chosen. 

The game should also be able to handle any unexpected input.

And lastly the game should give you the option to play again at the ending.
