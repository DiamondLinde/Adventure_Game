# Adventure Game

In this project I showcase some of my current skills using **_python_** to create a small text-based adventure game.

The game should have the user make a _choice_ and should play different scenarios based on which option is chosen. 

The game should also be able to handle any _unexpected input_.

And lastly the game should give you the option to _play again_ at the ending.
